# Python-DMD-Methods
The following codes will be for DMD/Koopman Methods. Codes will have different methods to compute Koopman Eigenvalues and Modes. hey will be verified by reproducing various papers from academia. The goal is to have these numerical methods written in Python (currently use Matlab). I currently am a researcher in Mezić Group at UCSB in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. 


Current codes:
1) Arnoldi-Like Method Algorithm.  
  Varified Paper: Nonlinear Koopman Modes and Power System Stability Assessment Without Models- Yoshihiko Susuki and Igor Mezić
2) Hankle-DMD Algorithm. (Working on)
3) exact-DMD Algorithm. (Working on)
