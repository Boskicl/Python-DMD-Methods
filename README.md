# Python-DMD-Methods
The following codes will be for Dynamic Mode Decomposition(DMD)/Koopman Methods. Codes will have different methods to compute Koopman Eigenvalues and Modes. They will be verified by reproducing various papers from academia. The goal is to have these numerical methods written in Python (currently use Matlab). I currently am a researcher in Mezić Group at UCSB in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. 


# Current codes:
1) Arnoldi-Like Method Algorithm.  
  Varified Paper: Susuki, Yoshihiko, and Igor Mezić. "Nonlinear Koopman modes and power system stability assessment without models." IEEE Transactions on Power Systems 29.2 (2014): 899-907.
2) SVD-DMD Algorithm. (Working on)-- Have code made with generated data.
3) exact-DMD Algorithm. (Working on)

# Code Use:
The codes have their own data files for them specifically data from the papers. Most of the codes I will upload will only require you to put in your own data file (excel file or mat file or whatever you use) and run the code.
